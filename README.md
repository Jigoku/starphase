# Star Phase
A side-scrolling space shooter made with Lua and Love2D
This is still an early work in progress, so many bugs / changes will come.

To create a love2d executable on Linux, simply run the script;
`` $ ./make_dist.sh ``

To launch the game directly, use this command in the working directory;
`` $ love . ``

On all other platforms (windows/mac) you simply need to compress the game data into a zip archive and change the extension to ".love"

Requirements;
Install the love2d library from here https://love2d.org

See `binds.lua` for game controls
