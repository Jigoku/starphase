# Star Phase
A top down space shooter made with Lua and Love2D
This is still an early work in progress, so many bugs / changes will come.

### Running the game
To create a love2d executable on Linux, simply run the script `` $ ./make_dist.sh ``
To launch the game directly, use this command in the working directory `` $ love . ``

On all other platforms (windows/mac) you simply need to compress the game data into a zip archive and change the extension to ".love"


### Requirements
Install the love2d library from here https://love2d.org

### Controls
See `binds.lua` for game controls
